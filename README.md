The Cox model with time-varying coefficients relaxes the proportional hazards assumption of the usual Cox model and is particularly useful to model time-to-event outcomes. We proposed a One-shot Distributed Algorithm to fit multi-center Cox regression models with Time varying coefficients (ODACT). This algorithm constructed a surrogate likelihood function to approximate the Cox partial likelihood function, using patient-level data from a lead site and aggregated data from other sites. The performance of ODACT was demonstrated by simulation and a real-world study of opioid use disorder (OUD) using decentralized data from a large clinical research network across 5 sites with 69,163 subjects.
